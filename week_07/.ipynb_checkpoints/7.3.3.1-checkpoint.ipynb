    "# Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects \n",

    "\n",
    "1. If we know that some people react differently to the treatment, we might be able to reason about \"why\" the treatment is working the way it does. (*Although as we're going to talk about later in the course, this is a pretty risky enterprise, at least if you have to make precise, evidence-based statements.*) \n",
    "2. If we know that some people react differently to treatment than others, we might want to *target* the treatment to reach certain populations (and not others). \n",

In `hte_mod` you've permitted more model flexibility: namely that the treatment effects for men and women can be different. To test for whether the more flexible model has out-performed the less flexible model, recall in the F-test from 203. \n",
