    "\n",
    "But, despite the somewhat obtuse language that we might use when we're talking about potential outcomes (e.g. \"The potential outcome to treatment, when a unit is assigned to treatment.\") the math surrounding potential outcomes is actually pretty straightforward. \n",

    "Suppose that we have 1,000 individuals that we can observe in our study. Furthermore, suppose that for each of these people, there is some *latent*, or unmeasured, response to treatment that they *would* have to treatment if we assigned them to take the treatemnt. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might think of this as an unknowable population-level parameter that we're trying to estimate from empirical data. In this worksheet, we're going to make the data so that the causal parameter $\\tau$ has a mean value of 2. But, you could imagine that some other treatment has a mean value of 100. Or, for some third treatment it could have a mean value of zero, in which case we would say there there is *no* treatment effect. \n",
