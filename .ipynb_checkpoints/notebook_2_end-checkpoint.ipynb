    "You might think of this as an unknowable population-level parameter that we're trying to estimate from empirical data. In this worksheet, we're going to make the data so that the causal parameter $\\tau$ has a mean value of 2. But, you could imagine that some other treatment has a mean value of 100. Or, for some third treatment it could have a mean value of zero, in which case we would say there there is *no* treatment effect. \n",
